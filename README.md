# Fractal-Explorer

This is my first ever App, coded together with a classmate in Python. (A lot of spahetti code)

To start click on "ClicktoStart.py"

The main class is found in FractalAlpha.py

This program is mainly designed to draw different shape of Line Fractals, it can also draw some other fractals.
